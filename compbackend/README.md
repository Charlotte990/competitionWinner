Resources I used to help me with this:

https://graphql.org/code/#go
https://github.com/graphql-go/graphql/tree/master/examples/crud
https://alligator.io/vuejs/rest-api-axios/
https://vuejs.org/v2/cookbook/using-axios-to-consume-apis.html
https://charlottej.co.uk - yes my own notes helped me (success!)

To get service running, save this project into $HOME/go/src/
Then run go build && go run main.go
You should see a comment in the terminal that the server is running on port :8080
